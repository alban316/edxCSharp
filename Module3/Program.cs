        Create a method to get information for a teacher, a course, a uprogram, and a degree using a similar method as above.

        Create methods to print the information to the screen for each object such as static void PrintStudentDetails(...).
            
        From within Main(), call each of the methods to prompt for input from a user of your application.
            
        Just enter enough information to show you understand how to use methods.  (At least three attributes each).
            
        Assign the values that are input, to the proper variables.
            
        Output the values of each object using the "print" methods that you created.
